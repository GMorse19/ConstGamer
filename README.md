## Planning

This is my fourth and final project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly) Full Stack Immersive program. The first thing I needed to decide for this project, was which framework to use. I opted to use React.js.

Having just recently learned React.js, I wanted to keep my first version of the project relatively basic. I also wanted to leave the door open to expand on the project as my comfort level within the framework grew.

To do this I decided upon a site that could host multiple types of games. I figured if all goes well, I can add an endless line of games to the app.
